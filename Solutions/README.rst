Solutions to the Exercises
##########################

In this dir, find solutions to the various exercises used in the intro course.

Note that there are of course more than one way to solve any problem, but these solutions try to be clean and Pythonic, without using features too advanced for that time in class. In some cases, more than one solution is provided.

If you have ideas about how to do it differently or better or cleaner -- or even if you find a typo or two, please consider a PR to add to / improve on these.
